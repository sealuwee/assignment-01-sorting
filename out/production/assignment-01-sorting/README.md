**Requirement 1**: RandomizedQuickSort.java

**Requirement 2**: Chose to do InsertionSort as my secondary quadratic sorting algorithm.

- I chose to do InsertionSort because, like BubbleSort, InsertionSort's best case time complexity is
O(n), and I figured since we'd be implementing some kind of hybrid sort between a quadratic sort + quick sort
it'd make sense to use a best case O(n) algorithm since the average and worst cases are all the same for every
quadratic sort.

**Requirement 3**: ModifiedQuadraticSort.java

**Requirement 4**: HybridSort.java
